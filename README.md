# Assortment of Random Problems

This repository contains random problems not used in any of Holberton School's projects, but may appear in various places such as problems given by other people, mock interviews, or online.

# Description

As the problems may vary, the instructions too will vary. As such, it is extremely unlikely that any two problems share the exact same set of instructions

|[vowel_swap.py](https://github.com/Alouie412/random_problem_land/blob/master/vowel_swap.py) | Python problem that swaps the position of all vowels (and y). Currently only supports 1 string, though multiple strings can be entered through usage of underscores (for example, "hello_world" will be interpreted as 1 string, whereas "hello world" will be interpreted as 2, and only hello will be used). Worked in conjunction with [Travis Bearden](https://github.com/Beardocracy)| 1/8/2020 |
|[exclusive_product.py](https://github.com/Alouie412/random_problem_land/blob/master/exclusive_product.py) | Python problem that returns a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i (for example, an array of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] will have a new array of [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. Features the naive logic with nested for loops and uses division, the logic without nested for loops but with division, the logic without division but with nested for loops, and the logic without nested for loops or division. It is apparently a coding problem asked by Uber. | 1/29/2020
|[matching_expressions.c](https://github.com/Alouie412/random_problem_land/blob/master/matching_expressions.c) | C problem that checks whether two strings are a match. Could easily be done using strcmp... if it weren't for the presence of periods and asterisks. For periods, treat it as a wildcard that can match any single character. For asterisks, treat as any number of characters that precede the asterisk. It is apparently a coding problem asked by Facebook. | 2/26/2020
