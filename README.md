# Assortment of Random Problems

This repository contains random problems not used in any Holberton School's projects, but may appear in various places such as problems given by other people, mock interviews, or online.

# Description

As the problems may vary, the instructions too will vary. As such, it is extremely unlikely that any two problems share the exact same set of instructions

|[vowel_swap.py](https://github.com/Alouie412/random_problem_land/blob/master/vowel_swap.py) | Python problem that swaps the position of all vowels (and y). Currently only supports 1 string, though multiple strings can be entered through usage of underscores (for example, "hello_world" will be interpreted as 1 string, whereas "hello world" will be interpreted as 2, and only hello will be used) |
