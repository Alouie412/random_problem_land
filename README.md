# Assortment of Random Problems

This repository contains random problems not used in any Holberton School's projects, but may appear in various places such as problems given by other people, mock interviews, or online.

# Description

As the problems may vary, the instructions too will vary. As such, it is extremely unlikely that any two problems share the exact same set of instructions

| File Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|[vowel_swap.py](https://github.com/Alouie412/random_problem_land/blob/master/vowel_swap.py) | Python problem that swaps the position of all vowels (and y). Currently only supports 1 string from user input, though multiple strings can be connected with underscore (for example, "hello_world" will be accepted as 1 string, but only hello from "hello world" will be accepted) |
